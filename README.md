# linux_cheat_sheets

## Background

I have created this repo to contain all the commands I needed to learn for the LFCS exam in 2018. I've had plans to standardize the formatting of the docs but this is very likely never going to happen. 

Feel free to fork and use to your own delight and may the Linux gods help you in your quest to attain a certificate.
