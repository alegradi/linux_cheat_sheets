Partitioning, filesystems, encrypted fs - 2nd edition

Partitioning
- fdisk  “/dev/device”  (is the utility, max 4 primary partitions)
- gdisk “/dev/devicename”  (up to 128 primary partitions)

- fdisk -l  (to list all devices) or use  cat /proc/partitions  (to see all partitions)

gdisk
- gdisk -l “/dev/device”  (to see device and partition information)
- gdisk “/dev/devicename"  (to work on that disc, interactive mode)
	+2G  (for the size in gdisk, example)

After using fdisk/gdisk you get a "kernel partition table synchronization error" use partprobe

Filesystems
mkfs tab tab to see possible filesystems to create
- mkfs.ext4 “/dev/devicename"  (to create a filesystem with defaults)
- mkfs.ext4 “/dev/device” -b 4096 -L spare_drive  (blocksize 4096, label)
  
Mounting devices
- mount /dev/"devicename" /"mountpoint"  (to mount a partition)
	- Example  mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
	- Can do by label (if there is) mount LABEL="label" /mnt
	- umount /mnt  (to unmount the partition mounted at /mnt)
	- mount -o remount /”mountpoint”  (to read changes from fstab)

Swap
To create a swap partition just create a partition first, then change its type to Linux/Swap
- mkswap “/dev/diskname"  (to create the swap structure on it)
-mkswap  “/dev/diskname” -L “label”  (to add a label)
	- swapon “/dev/diskname"  (to manually mount)
	- swapoff “/dev/diskname”  (to unmount)
	- free -m  (to check the availability of the swap)
Put it into fstab  /dev/"diskname"/  swap  swap  defaults  0 0 
		- swapon -a  to activate

Fstab examples
If possible use UUID or labels to identify disks!
/dev/sdb1  /xfs  xfs  defaults  0 0
/dev/sda2  /  ext4  usrquota,grpquota 0 0  (to enable quotas) 
LABEL=xfsfs /xfs  xfs  defaults 0 0 

192.168.0.9:/nfs_share  /mnt/nfs  nfs  auto,intr  0 0  (nfs share) (man nfs)
//server/share /mnt/smb  cifs  user=”smbuser”,password=”password”  0 0  (samba)

- To test the fstab file,  mount -a  (mounts everything that is not mounted yet)

Encrypted file-system (The order of operations is very important in this case)

- Check for availability of  dm_crypt  module in the kernel
- Create a partition
- cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/"disk"
- cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/"disk” “name"  (name is by which it will be recognized)
	- Now the drive is created in /dev/mapper/"name"
- mkfs."filesys" /dev/mapper/"name"  (can add label with -L "label")
	- Can mount at this point manually by  mount 					/dev/mapper/"name" /"mountpoint"
- To automate mounting
	- /etc/crypttab
		"name"  /dev/"disk"
	-/etc/fstab 
		/dev/mapper/"name"  /"mountpoint"  "filesys"  noauto  0 0
	- noauto is important as requiring a password might trip up the boot process!!

Misc
For ssd driver make sure that fstrim is being run every now and then
	- Look for  fstrim.timer  and  fstrim.service
	- systemctl enable fstrim.timer  to have it run at intervals (check file)
