The Kernel - 2nd Edition

1, lsmod | less  (To see the kernel modules (drivers))

2, modinfo "modulename"  (to see extended info of a module)

3, To load or unload a module use  modprobe
	- modprobe -r "modulename"  (to unload)
	- modprobe "modulename"  (to load)
	- dmesg  (to verify, kernel buffer ring print)

4, To pass in options into the module
	- In  /etc/modprobe.d/  place the "modulename.conf" file
	
	- In the file  options "modulename" "parameter"="value"
		- example:  /etc/modprobe.d/cdrom.conf 
		- options cdrom autoclose=1

5, Optimizing the kernel can be done through  /proc
	- Use  cat  on files, vim wont work, to see information
	
	- /proc/sys  contains cernel tunables
		- For runtime edit  echo  value into files
		- For permanent edit see  /etc/sysctl.conf  -overrides everything!
		- See  /etc/sysctl.d/  for more info
		- sysctl -a  to see all tuneables
		- sysctl -a | grep "something"  to look for something specific
		- sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=0  (to write a change to the tuneable)
			- sysctl -p  (to apply changes)
