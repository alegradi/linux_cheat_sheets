Permissions and quotas -2nd 

Basic permissions 

		File 	Directory
read (4)	read	list
write (2)	modify	Create, delete
execute (1)	run	cd


1, To change ownership
- chgrp "group" "file/folder"
	- chgrp -R admin /var/log  (recursively)

- chown "user":"group" "file/folder"
	- chown -v root:staff /u  (verbose)
	- chown root /u 

2, To change permissions
- chmod g+w /home  for example (relative mode)
- chmod o-rx /home 
	
- chmod 700 "file"  for example (absolute mode)

Advanced permissions


		File				Directory
SUID (4)	Run as owner !!! (danger)	-
SGID		Run as group owner!!! 		New files inherit group o.
Sticky bit (1)	-				Can delete only if owner

chmod u+s "file"  (Set UID, command is executed as owner of the file and not the person running it. Very dangerous!)

chmod g+s  (Set GUID, files created will get the parent directory ownership)

chmod o+t  (Sticky bit, only the owner of the file, or the owner of the group can delete the file)

Finding files with specific permissions
man find  search for  -perm

- find . -perm 0600 -exec ls -l {} \;
- find . -perm 4000 -exec ls -l {} \;
	- Looking for setUID

1, Acces control lists
Normal -> Which applies to existing files
Default -> Applies to new files

getfacl "file/directory" (to see ACLs)

setfacl -R -m g:sales:rx account (order important)
	- Recursive, modify, sales group gains read and execute on account folder

setfacl -m d:g:sales:rx accounts 
	- sets default ACL
setfacl -b  (to restore default (user, group, owner))

Attributes - Applies to files only
Needs fs support, if not available, needs to use  user_xattr  as option on mount

- man chattr  (to see all supported attributes by file systems)
- chattr +i "file"  (adds the immutable attribute to the file)
	+a “file”  (append only) 
- lsattr "file"  (to see attributes of a file)

File system quota in ext4 
Needs to have  quota  package installed. The filesystem needs to support the quota, so in /etc/fstab  you need to have  usrquota,grpquota  (in place of defaults)

- chmod -R 777 /"mountpoint"  (to make sure the mountpoint is accessible)

- quotacheck -mavug  (creates aquota.group, aquota.user )
- quota -vu "user"  (to see current quota settings)
- quotaon -a  (to enable quotas, make sure it starts on boot)
- edquota -u "username" or -g "groupname"  (to edit quotas)
	- This is a file edited in vi. Just change the values there. inodes refers to number of files (which is dumb)
	- Test it with  dd if=/dev/zero of=/quota/bigfile bs=1M count=3 
		- bs  blocksize, this would be a 3MB file

- edquota -p "user1" "user2"  (to copy quota settings from user1 to user2)
- repquota -aug  (to see current quotas)
