SELinux and AppArmor

SELinux â€“ Mainly used on RHEL 
1, SELinux can be only enabled or disabled (needs reboot when changed)
	- getenforce  to get info

2, If SELinux is enabled it can be in
	- enforcing mode, use  setenforce enforcing (or permissive)
	- permissive mode (for troubleshooting)

3, Config files can be at
	- /etc/sysconfig/selinux
	- /etc/selinux/config

4, SELinux labels, can be seen in many commands with -Z
	- ls -lZ  to see it on files
	- ps Zaux  to see it on processes
	- netstat -Ztulpen  to see it with network connections

5, To change context (labels for different items) for files and services
	- man semanage-fcontext
	- semanage fcontext -a -t "type" ""folder""  and always needs to be followed by
	- restorecon -R -v "folder"
	- to change if for ports for example
		- semanage port -a -t ssh_port_t -p tcp "portnumber"

6, To see booleans  getsebool -a
	- use it like  getsebool -a | grep "ftp"
	- setsebool "boolean" on (or off)
	- setsebool -P "boolean" off  is a persistant solution

AppArmor 
Profile files are stored at  /etc/apparmor.d

apparmor_status  (to get report on apparmor)

aa-enforce /path/to/file  (to place a process in enforce mode)
aa-complain /path/to/file  (to place a process in complain mode)
aa-complain /etc/apparmor.d/*  (to place all services in complain mode)
sudo ln -s /etc/apparmor.d/profile.name /etc/apparmor.d/disable/  (to disable a profile)

To get more profiles, need to install  apparmor-profiles  package, you might need apparmor-utils  for other uses, such as aa-logprof  (to vie complains of processes)
