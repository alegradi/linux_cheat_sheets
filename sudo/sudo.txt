Others

- su - "user"  to log in as "user", you need to have the “user” password to be able to use it, or you have to be root, being a sudoer is not enough

su -  (to log in as root)

sudo -i  (to start a new session as root)

chvt #  (to change to that virtual terminal is the same as  ctrl+alt+f#) 
/etc/securetty  (contains the consols that root can log into (secure ports/consoles))
