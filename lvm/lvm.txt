LVM - Logical Volume Management - 2nd Edition

Hierarchy
	^	Filesystem
	|	Logical Volume
	|	Volume Group
	|	Physical Volume
	|	Partition ( need to be set as LVM in order to use as Physical volume)
	–	HDD
Always start from the bottom and work your way up ( at resizing the same applies)

Fdisk to create a new partition or if this is a VM and existing disk was extended you can use
growpart /dev/sdx <disk number>  (to grow a disk)

Physical Volume
- pvcreate /dev/"disk"  (to create a physical volume)
- pvremove /dev/”disk”  (to remove a physical volume from the pool)
- pvs  (to display physical volumes in short)
- pvdisplay (to display detailed info on them)

Volume Group
- vgcreate "vgname" /dev/"disk"  (to create a volume group from physical volumes)
- vgremove “vgname”  (to remove a volume group)
- vgextend “vgname” /dev/”disk”  (to extend the volume group)
- vgreduce “vgname” /dev/”disk”  (to remove a physical volume from a volume g)
- vgdisplay
- vgs

Logical Volume
- lvcreate  -L "size" -n "name" "name of the volume group"
	- lvcreate -L 1G -n home vg1  (for example)
	- lvcreate -l 756 -n home vg1  (size in extents)
- lvextend -r -L “size” /dev/”vgname”/”lvname”  (with resizing the filesystem)
	- lvextend -r -L +1G /dev/vg_1/lvm_home  (adding 1G)
	- lvextend -r -l +100%FREE /dev/vg1/lvm1  (to extend with extents)
- lvreduce -r -L -2G /dev/”vgname”/”lvname”  (to reduce with 2G)
- lvremove /dev/”vgname”/”lvname”  (to remove an lvm)
- lvdisplay
- lvs

Filesystem
mkfs.ext4 -L “label” /dev/mapper/”device”

Mounting
To mount it persistently, you need to hunt down the device first in /dev/. Its going to be probably in /dev/"volume group name"/"logical volume name"
- Add a filesystem to it, for example ext4
	- mkfs.ext4 /dev/...
- Add entry to  /etc/fstab  with the symlink to the device in /dev/mapper/ like:
	/dev/mapper/"vgname-lvname"  /"mountpoint"  "fs"  defaults  0 0	
- Can do by LABEL for which use  tune2fs -L "label" /dev/...
	LABEL="label"  /"mountpoint"  "fs"  defaults  0 0
- Can do by UUID for which use  blkid to show the UUID
	UUID="UUID......"  /"mountpoint"  "fs"  defaults  0 0
	
- Mount with  mount -a  when done
	- verify with  mount

Resizing LVM
For resizing remember to start at the bottom of the hierarchy always!! 
	
To extend the file system follow the order
- Make a partition available, create and make it Linux LVM
- vgextend "vgname"(existing on to be extended) /dev/"disk"(new partition you created)
	- Does  pvcreate  automatically!
- lvextend -r(resize filesystem!!!) -l +100%FREE(extents) /dev/"vgname"/"lvmname"(to be extended)
	
To reduce the file system follow the order
- lvreduce -r -L "size"(2G for ex) /dev/"vgname"/"lvname"
- vgreduce /dev/"vgname" /dev/"physical volume"
