Users and groups - 3rd edition

User related commands
For creating users there's two main commands, 
	- useradd  (good for scripting) and  adduser  (ubuntu) 
- adduser "user"  (will start an interactive mode, asking questions, ubuntu way)

-useradd -m -s /bin/bash/ “user”  (is typical usage, after which you still have to use)
	- passwd “user”
	- mkdir /home/”user”
	- cp -rT /etc/skel /home/”user” 

- useradd -D  (to see the defaults for creating a user with useradd)
- useradd "user"
- useradd -d /home/employee/jano -m -s /bin/bash jano  (with different home dir., 	/home/employee must exist before running the command!)
- useradd -m -e 2018-03-21  (to set expiry date)

- userdel -r “username”  (r is suggested to clean eveything that belongs to a user)

For aging options of the password and the account, and other interactive configs:
- chage "username"  (puts you in an interactive mode)
- chfn “username” (to change full name, interactive mode)
- chsh “username” (to change default shell, interactive mode)
- passwd “username”  (to set/change the password)

- /etc/passwd  (contains the user information, if need to edit use  vipw)
-/etc/shadow  (contains the password related info)
- pwck  (to verify integrity of the passwd and shadow files)

Usermod

- usermod -aG "groupname" "username"  (to append groups to an existing user)
- usermod -G “groupname,groupname” “username”  (to remove the user from groups not listed)
- usermod -L "username"  (to lock a user)
- usermod -U "username"  (to unlock a user)
- usermod -e 2018-03-27 “username”  (to change expiry date)

Groups
- id "username"  (shows what groups a user belongs to and their id)
- groups “username”  (to show the groups a user belongs to)
- groupadd "groupname"  (to add a group)

- groupdel "groupname"
- groupmod "groupname"

gpasswd  - use it to set and remove password for a group, restrict access, add users to group, set admins for group
- gpasswd “groupname”  (to set a password on a group, after which you can change to it (it becomes your default group))

- nwgroup “groupname”  (you need the password for that group)

- /etc/group  (contains the information about groups, can manually add user to a group)
- grpck  (to verify integrity of the gshadow gpasswd files)


Changing defaults for users and groups
- useradd -D  (to see default settings, for users)

- /etc/default/useradd  (will contain this information)
- /etc/login.defs  (contains password aging options)
- /etc/skel/  (contains the files that are copied to every new user created)

Resource access restriction 
- /etc/security/limits.conf  (to limit resources)
