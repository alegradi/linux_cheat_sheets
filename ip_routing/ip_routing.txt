IP routing - Basics

Static ip routing
ip route show  (to see current ip routing table)
route -n  (is the same, legacy method)

To add a new route manually
route add -net "ip" netmask "ip" gw "ip" dev "device"
ip route add "ip/nm" via "ip" dev "devicename"

To delete a route
ip route delete "ip/nm"


Dynamic ip routing
The server effectively becomes a switch (For testing, use a server machine and a client, steps are in order)

quagga  package is needed, based on  zebra
/etc/quagga/daemons  file needs to be edited
	 zebra=1
	 ripd=1
- Create  zebra.conf
	service quagga restart
	hostname "hostname"
	password quagga
- Create  ripd.conf
	with same content as  zebra.conf

chown quagga.quaggavty *.conf 
chmod 640 *.conf
- Restart quagga service

Testing with telnet
- telnet localhost 2601
- Enter password when prompted
enable → configure terminal →  inter "devicename" →  ip address "ip/nm" → exit → write → quit → quit

- telnet localhost 2602
enable → configure terminal → router rip → version 2 → network "ip/nm" → exit → write → exit → exit 

- ip route show
On the client
- ip route add default via "server ip"
