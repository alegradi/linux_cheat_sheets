sses - 3rd Edition

Bash - basics
In bash if something is running use ctrl+z to pause it
- bg  (to have it run in the background)
- jobs (to check what is running in the background)
- fg # (to bring something to the foreground (or just fg for the last one placed there))
	
- can start a command to run in the background with & added at the end  sleep 600 &

top
- 1  for seeing the number of cpu cores
- f  for fields (in there press s on a field to sort by that)
- top -u "username" to see processes run by that user
- W to save new settings
- r  for renice (-20 very not nice - to 19 which is very nice to others)  

ps
to see the list of processes, two main uses  ps aux  or  ps axjf  for a treelike view
	- ps aux | less  (for all processes (always use less))
	- ps aux --sort pmem (to sort on process memory)
	- ps axjf

nice and renice
	- nice -n #(-20 - 19) command
	- renice -n # PID

kill
	- kill -l  (to see list of signals)
	- man 7 signal  (for a thorough description of signals)
	- SIGTERM 15  (to nicely close something (might be ignored))
	- SIGKILL 9  (to murder brutally (avoid using if possible))
	- killall "programname" (to kill all instances)
 	- kill PID  (to send a signal)
	- kill -9 PID (also works)
	

pgrep “programname”  (to search in a better way!)
pidof "programname" (to show the PID numbers of said program) "programname" to show the PID numbers of said program
