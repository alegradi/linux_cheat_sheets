Apache web server -2nd 

This is a very simple explanation for apache2 and enabling virtual hosts. Apache is capable much more than what is included here but this should be enough for the LFCS test

Apache setup

1, Install apache2

2, Main configuration file is in:
	- /etc/apache2

3, To enable virtual hosts do the following (order can vary):
	- Create a copy of  /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-				default.conf  with the name of the site.conf
		- testserver.com.conf  for example
	
	- Edit the newly created file, and add the details of: (with examples)
		ServerAdmin webasmter@localhost
		ServerName testserver.com 
		ServerAlias www.testserver.com
		DocumentRoot /var/www/"Your directory"
	
	- Create the directory you specified in the config file and place the index.html 	there
	
	- Edit  /etc/hosts  file and include the newly created site
		- 192.168.0.12   www.testserver.com testserver.com  for example
	
	- Open port 80 (or 443 for ssl) on the firewall
	
	- Create the symlink to enable the site
		- From /etc/apache2/sites-available/"yoursite.conf" to 		/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/"yoursite.conf"
	
	- Reload apache config files
		- systemctl reload apache2.service

Restricting access to a site

/etc/apache2/apache2.conf  or the site config file
	</Directory /var/www/hostname/>
		Order allow,deny
		Allow from ip
		Allow from ip
Apache with SSL setup
With self signed certificates

mkdir /etc/apache2/ssl-certs  (I chose this)
- in the folder
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/apache2/ssl-certs/apache.key -out /etc/apache2/ssl-certs/apache.crt
	x509  (is a type)
	-nodes  (don’t encrypt key)
Fill in the required info

Server setup

Ok, this can be a bit tricky, you might need to
	- Create symlinks to enable ssl mod
	- Use a .shtml instead of an .html
	- Edit the default ssl-vhost.conf file in the /sites-available
	- Open port 443 for ssl
	- You will still receive an error from the browser because its going to be a self 	signed certificate… bastards
